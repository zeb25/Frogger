## Sprint 1 Tasks and Results:

### Wade:
- Car Sprites and Hit Detection
 - **Status**: Complete. There are 5 distinct car sprites that move across the screen at different speeds and directions. When the frog is hit by a car, it respawns at the start and loses a life.
  - **Branch**: I pushed changes to branch "feature/cars"
