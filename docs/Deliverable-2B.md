## Sprint 1 Tasks and Results:

### Wade:
- Car Sprites and Hit Detection
 - **Status**: Complete. There are 5 distinct car sprites that move across the screen at different speeds and directions. When the frog is hit by a car, it respawns at the start and loses a life.
  - **Branch**: I pushed changes to branch "feature/cars"

### Liz:
- Get the lily pads on the screen and get the frog to jump to them.
 - **Status**: Half completed. I have the lily pads done but I am still trying to work with the movement logic for the frog to go on the lily pads.
 - **Branch**: I pushed changes to a branch called "lily-pads‚Äù

### David:
- Log sprites
 - **Status**: Complete.  Did this really early becasue I had extra time.  3 different log types cross the screen with different patterns.  They will pick up the from and move him with them.
-Turtle Sprites
- **Status**: Done.  Two different turtle patterns.  Both have turtles that rise and sink.  The move the frog unless sunk.
 - **Branch**: Pushed changes to "DavidBranchPart2"  which I probably should have named more descriptively.
