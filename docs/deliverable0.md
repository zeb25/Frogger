# Frogger by Zoe Bell, Wade Bradford, Liz Manero, and David Poulin

## Project Description

A "Frogger" style arcade game.

In Frogger, players play as a frog trying to avoid obstacles such as snakes, alligators, and cars as they hop across a busy road or a river full of moving logs and turtles. The player can move in orthogonal paths and can earn extra points by eating flies along the way. There is a clock running to give players a time limit to get the frog across all obstacles. The goal is to get all the frogs safely across the road/river and onto one of the lily pads.

Our team is still deciding how we will implement AI, but some ideas we have right now are:

- A race mode where the player races against the computer to see who can get all their frogs across the fastest.
- Another iteration where the player is racing against the AI to see who can get the most points in an allotted amount of time.

There is also the possibility for different "modes" of play, such as Easy, Medium, and Hard. With these different modes, we can adjust the speed of moving obstacles, the time limit that the player has, and the frequency of "enemies" like snakes and alligators.
