Deliverable 3B

Tasks:
- Add game over screen at lives = 0 (easy, essential)
Implemented.  You will see it when you play and your lives hit zero.

- Add timer for frog death/restart (medium, nice to have)
Implemented.  The frog dies when the 60 second timer hits zero.

- Add side screen collisions (easy, essential)
Implemented.  The fromg now dies if he hits left, right, or bottom (with a little wiggle room on the botom for when he goes sideways/changes orientation).

- Improve upper bounds around lily pads (hard, essential)
Implemented.  The frog will now die if he hits the grass at the top of the screen.  Go between to hit the lily pads and be safe.

- Change lily pad color/mark lily pad with frog (medium, essential)

- Implement sounds (medium, nice to have) (not currently planned but might be a stretch goal)
Not Implemented.  This was a stretch goal and we decided not to do it.

- Update start screen with full instructions text (easy, important)
Implemented.  When you start the game you will now see clear instuctions on the start screen.

- Blue frog (hard, nice-to-have)
Not Implemented:  Was kind of a stretch goal that never ended up happenning.
- Flies (medium, nice-to-have)
Not Implemented:  Was kind of a stretch goal that never ended up happenning.

- Tidy code: move classes into separate files and all attachments into the assets folder (easy, nice-to-have)
