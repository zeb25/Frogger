## Sprint 1 Tasks and Results:

### Everyone:
- Familiarize ourselves with Python Arcade enough so that we are all comfortable with using it individually

### Zoe:
- Fix bounding for frog movement on the screen  
  - **Status**: Semi completed. The frog is now unable to move above a certain point in the game grid, but I am still working on how to get the frog to "jump" to the water spaces in between the grass at the top of the grid.  
  - **Branch**: Changes pushed to "obstacles" branch â€“ still figuring out how to merge separate branches.

### Liz:
- Get the start screen going.
 - **Status**: Completed.  The game displays a start screen before the game begins.  To start the game you need to press S.  I eventually want to make the start screen more excting with images to make it visually appealing.
  - **Branch**: I pushed changes to a branch called "start-screen".  I also need to figure out how to merge seperate branches.

### David:
- Get moving objects across the screen
 - **Status**: Completed.  Objects move across screen and reset.  Currently there are three logs moving at different speeds.  Each of these will soon be turned into a pattern and adjusted to the correct sizes.

### Wade:
- Gameplay logic pseudo-code
 - **Status**: In-Progress. The sprite frog can move around the screen with the sprite png rotated based on direction. There is also a score displayed that increments as the frog moves up the screen and a lives counter displayed without functionality.
  - **Branch**: I pushed changes to branches "basic-frog-movement" and "scoring-text".
