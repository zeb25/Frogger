# Final-Project
Final Project for CS 3050 Software Engineering Fall 2024

## About the Project
This project is a recreation of the classic arcade game Frogger. The objective is to navigate the frog across a busy road and a hazardous river to reach the safety of the lily pads. The game is developed as a final group project for Software Engineering.

## Instructions
1. Use the arrow keys to move the frog
2. Avoid cars and other obstacles when crossing the road
3. Cross the river by jumping on logs and turtles (beware of disappearing turtles!)
4. Reach the lily pads to win the game
5. Beware of the clock counting down towards your demise.
