Frogger by Zoe Bell, Wade Bradford, Liz Manero, and David Poulin 

Project Description: A "Frogger" style arcade game.  

In Frogger players play as a frog trying to avoid obstacles such as snakes, alligators, and cars as they hop across a busy road or a river full of moving logs and turtles. 
The player can move in orthogonal paths and can earn extra points by eating flies along the way. 
There is a clock running to give players a time limit to get the frog across all obstacles. 
The goal is to get all the frogs safely across the road/river and on one of the lily pads.
